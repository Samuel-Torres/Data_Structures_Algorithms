Types of Algorithms:

    • Sorting Algorithms: To sort data is ascending or descending order. 
    • Searching Algorithms: To find specific a specific value in a data set.
    • Graph Algorithms:  To work with data that can be represented as graphs.
    • Dynamic Programming: To solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems.
    • Divide & Conquer: To solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, sub-problems
        independently, and then combining the results.
