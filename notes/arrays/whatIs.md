Arrays:

    • ordered list of items which stores data. 
    • Array can store data of specified type. 
    • Elements of an array are located in a contigous
    • Each element of an array has unique index

Types of Array:

    One-Dimensional: an array with a bunch of values having been declared with a single index.
        arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5... ]
        accessing data in one dimensional array: arr[2] = 3

    Multi-Dimensional Array: An array with other nested arrays. 
        multiArr = [
                    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5...],
                    [4, 5, 6, 7, 8...],
                    [9, 0, 1, 2, 3...],
                   ]
        accessing data in one dimensional array: a[i][j]

        multiArr[0][1] = 2
        multiArr[2][4] = 3
        multiArr[2][0] = 9

Array memory allocation:
    For a one dimensional array in Random Access Memory "RAM" the memory unit used are aligned continously in order. Or contigously.
    For two dimensional array the
